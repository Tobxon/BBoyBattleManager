# B-Boy Battle Manager - Engine

The engine subproject is doing the basic calculations to provide gui and other parts of the program with e.g. the next matches and all informations that need to be seperatly calculated.
The idea is to make the engine seperatly adjustable to get the results with different settings or different focus. (e.g. the calculation of the next matches done based on swiss tournament or a normal K.O. tournament, ..)
