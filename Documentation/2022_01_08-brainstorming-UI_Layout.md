# general behaviour

* user must always be able to see what is currently shown in presentation window -> small window somewhere that shows whats happening on the presentation window all the time (like a zoom call showing yourself)

## nice to have ideas:

* online preregistration (self registration)
* simultaneous tournaments / 2 formats interchanging (3v3, 1v1)
