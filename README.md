# B-Girl and B-Boy Battle Manager

This programm is going to be a gui application used to manage Breaking Events. It is planned to be tested in local battles of local partners as soon as it is in a useable state.


## About me

I am an inactive B-Boy still connected to the community and currently working on my career as a C++-developer. Therefore I use this as an happy island project for me to gain experience.


## About the approach of this project

This project is used to get familiar with the latest C++ features that are just supported by compilers. Therefore a lot of preview tools are currently used and it is not assured that the whole project will be in a stable state soon. 
For example I try to get used with C++20 modules using cmake and a gui framework while the full support is still under development.


## Getting Started

## Environment Variables needed

Add the path to your Qt installation and Catch2 (for Unit Tests) to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.

To run the program add the path to your Qt binaries to your PATH variables.

These configurations are exemplary shown in cmake/CmakePresets.json
